                It shares boundaries with the Akuapem North Municipal Assembly to the south and the Yilo Krobo Municipal Assembly to the east.

                <span>Terrain</span>:
                The district is characterized by its mountainous terrain, contributing to its cool climate.
                Key Features:
                The Akuapem Ridge itself is a significant geographical feature.</p>
                </p>
                <span>Migration and Travel</span>: <br>
                 Historical Migration:
                The Okere people, part of the Guan ethnic group, have a history of migration to the Akuapem Ridge.
